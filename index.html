<h2>My Journey</h2>
<p>I graduated from the Kansas City Art Institute with a bachelors degree in Fine Art focused on Illustration. While I enjoyed my time at that school, I quickly found that it wasn't something I was prepared to spend my life doing. Too many artists find commercial work and stop creating material they enjoy. I worked in the Printing industry for a little while following my relocation to Kansas City from Excelsior Springs. I enjoyed that work as well, but in two years I was laid off from two different companies. The first was a company called Henry Wurst, which went bankrupt. The second was a company called Modern Litho, who was forced to lay me off due to the outbreak of Covid-19. The printing industry still hasn't recovered, with many events such as concerts, conventions, and the like being suspended during the crisis.</p>

<p>With Printing going under as a result of the virus, I decided to take matters into my own hands and start a new career that hopefully would provide me more sustainability. This led me to discover Thinkful. I saw an add on facebook of all places, and after doing a month or so of research and talking to people, I finally decided to take the plunge on this journey.</p>

<p>So now, here I am. Excersizing creative muscles I've always had in interesting new ways. I'm excited to see where the next stage of my journey takes me.</p>
